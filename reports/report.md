## Data pre-processing
In summary of this project, we can note that:

- CIFAR10 dataset requires a lot of pre-processing for optimal results
    - The images are very blurred in nature and to mitigate this, brightness and contrast of images was done.

    - Other pre-processing involved normalization of images
